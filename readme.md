## Description

Modern theme that focuses on categories as well as pages and posts. Each page and each category, along with their corresponding children, will be displayed in a dropdown from the header section of the theme. These displays can be replaced with personalized menus instead if that is preferred. The theme also comes with an easier way to navigate to parent and child categories within each category. Widgets are stylized to match the theme.
